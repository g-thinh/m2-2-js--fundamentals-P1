// Q4
// Write a function that accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list with
// all of the even numbers removed.

//Solution

function removeEvens(lst) {
  // lst is an array of strings
  let result = lst.filter(element => element % 2 != 0);
  console.log(result);
}

console.log(
  'Q4 removeEvens()',

);
// should log [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
